# Deep-Segmentation
Deep Learning methods for semantic segmentation with weakly labelled data

Implementation of 

[Pinheiro, P. and Collobert, R.; From Image-level to Pixel-level Labeling with Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.6228v3.pdf)

The paper uses OverFeat. This implementation tests the algorithm out with the cifar10_cnn example network from keras. The modifications are 
applied on top of the same.
